## 🎯 My Journey

I started as an **ASP.NET Core Web Developer**, building backend systems and RESTful APIs using C#, SQL Server, and modern web technologies.

Over time, I became passionate about the power of data and machine learning — and made the jump into **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**. Now, I build intelligent systems using machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI.
